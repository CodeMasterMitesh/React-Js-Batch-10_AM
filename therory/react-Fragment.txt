React Fragments are a feature in React that allow you to group multiple elements returned by a component without adding an extra node to the DOM. 
Key characteristics and benefits of React Fragments:
Grouping without extra DOM nodes: In React, a component's render method must return a single root element. Traditionally, if you needed to return multiple sibling elements, you would wrap them in a <div> or <span>. Fragments provide a way to group these elements without introducing an unnecessary wrapper element into the rendered HTML.
Cleaner DOM structure: By avoiding extra <div> elements for mere grouping purposes, Fragments help maintain a cleaner and more efficient DOM structure. This can lead to better performance and simpler styling.
Improved semantic HTML: In cases where a wrapper <div> would break the semantic structure of your HTML (e.g., returning multiple <tr> elements directly within a <table>), Fragments allow you to maintain valid and semantic HTML.
Shorthand syntax: Fragments can be written using a concise shorthand syntax: <></>. This makes them easy to use and improves code readability.
