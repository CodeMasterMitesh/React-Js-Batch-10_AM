Why use .jsx files?

Clarity & Readability: You can write HTML-like markup directly inside JS.

Component-based structure: Each component can be a separate .jsx file.

Tooling support: Editors like VSCode give syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and linting for JSX.

Better maintenance: Easier to see structure of UI and logic together.

Note: Using .jsx is optional. You can write React components in .js files too. But .jsx makes it clear that this file contains JSX code.


example of hooks
import React,{useState} from "react";

const Counter = () =>{
    const [count,setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Count :{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={()=> setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
        </div>

    )
} 

export default Counter;
